Hey, I'm Joe Daly here to give you Joe daily

Have'nt really touched coding in a while but I know I'm gonna be learning R in my differential class sometime (I assume it's a Language)
Eventually will use LaTex at some point 

If I ever return to python I'll create the best RPG you've ever seen I'm sure
